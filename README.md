# Audio Classification using MFCC Spectrograms

## Overview
This project focuses on audio classification using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) spectrograms. The goal is to accurately classify audio data using the MNIST audio dataset.

## Features
- **MFCC Spectrograms**: Engineered an algorithm leveraging MFCC for precise spectral feature extraction from raw audio data.
- **CNN Architecture**: Developed and fine-tuned a CNN tailored to the project's requirements, achieving remarkable classification results.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 99%.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
